Aquaculture is a branch of agriculture. It refers to the live-stocks that are grown under water. Presently, the crop husbandry is not paying enough to the farmers. Hence, they are in search of alternate source of income. As a profitable venture, Aquaculture has become handy for them. Fresh water fish farming and shrimp culture is predominantly followed by the farming community. In fact, the shrimp culture is a highly profitable venture which even earn Foreign Exchange to the country.
