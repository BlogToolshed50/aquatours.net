Thanks to Wm Rowe

I love taking my kids to play tennis. As I&#8217;ve always been a big fan of the sport, and remember playing when I was young, it&#8217;s important to me to introduce the game to them early on, so that they can have such fond memories as well. Every year, we take inventory of how many tennis balls we have left, because they get lost so easily at the courts. We also figure out who needs a new racket, as the kids outgrow them quickly. Then, sometime in early spring, we head to a sporting goods store and pick out new rackets and balls.

This year, only my youngest daughter needed a new racket, but we decided that we would need at least three new canisters of balls. We packed up our equipment, set the home security alarm ([click here](http://www.inhomesecurity.net/adt-home-security-safety-tips.html "Click here for click here offers")), and made our way to the store. After we stocked up on supplies, we were ready to hit the courts right away to test them out.

We arrived at the courts, and were happy to find out that we had the area to ourselves. It was a beautiful, quiet day at the park, and my kids had so much [practicing](http://www.spiritualityandpractice.com/) against the backboard and challenging one another to matches. I had a great time playing, but it was more rewarding to watch them making memories they&#8217;ll cherish forever.
