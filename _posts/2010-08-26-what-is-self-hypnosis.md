Today, more and more people practice self hypnosis even at the comforts of their own homes. Although this can be done, it is best to do with if one has knowledge or background on the practice. To know more about self hypnosis, a research must be done before actually trying it or practicing it at home. Research on self hypnosis can be done by using the Internet and looking for online sites that offer information on the subject. With just one click on any search engine, thousands of references may appear on the screen. Look for those sites that can link you to what would you want to know about the practice so you won&#8217;t have to waste time in searching all those links. 

Aside from doing an online research, you can also get information from various books and magazines.

If you know people who have been practicing self hypnosis, you can also ask them for some tips on how to start with it and how to make it easier for you. 

One great way of being informed about self hypnosis is knowing how it started or where did it originate so you will have a better understanding of the practice. There were so many people who were considered as pioneers when it comes to self hypnosis. Many of them were influential in the practice and somehow formed what it is today just like Scottish physician and surgeon named James Braid who claims to discover self hypnosis or hypnotism in 1894. After discovering it, he first taught it to several clients before actually tried it to himself. His theory in self hypnosis says that but &#8220;feeling is the very truth&#8221; once you tried to use it when dealing with physical or emotional problems.
