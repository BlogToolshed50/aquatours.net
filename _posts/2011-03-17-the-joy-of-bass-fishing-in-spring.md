There is nothing quite like bass fishing in spring. The calm air, the warmth, the light breezes, and being one with nature is a feeling like no other and if you enjoy bass fishing like I do, then you’ll enjoy bass fishing in spring. I can remember many a day spent with my family bass fishing throughout the year, but the freshness of spring always stood out for me as some of our best experiences. I highly recommend trying bass fishing, especially in the spring season, with your family.

The thing to remember about bass fishing in spring is that the water temperatures are beginning to rise from the winter cold. The fish are starting to become more active as their metabolic rate rises with the rising heat, and this means that the bass move out of the deeper water in search of food after a long winter. Normally, bass can be found in fairly shallow areas searching for food in the bounty of the waters and finding them can be a treat for the fisherman.

Spawning in Spring

Spring is known as the “prespawn season”. There isn’t a specific time that the prespawning activities of bass will take place, though and they will basically occur at all sorts of different times and in different temperatures throughout the season. The prespawn season is categorized by the changes in the bass as they tend to be a lot less cautious in their ravenous search for food, companionship, and a spawning partner.

The bass move back and forth from the shallower waters a few times a day to feed, so finding them in the shallow portions can be generally easy. Bass eat high energy foods in the spring like crawdads and other smaller fish that help give them the protein they need to accomplish all the goals they have in the spawning season. Making yourself familiar with the location of the shallower portions of the body of water in which you are fishing is always a good strategy for catching that giant haul of bass.

Also, become familiar with the foods in the lake and hide out there. Staking out the good crawdad areas is a surefire way to locate large pools of bass. Look for trees, stumps, rock piles or other debris that run from shallow to deep and troll that area. A good angler also becomes familiar with the size of the bass food of choice and lures his or her rod accordingly to try and slip one past the fish.

Bass fishing in spring requires you to do a little research, but in the end it is one of the most rewarding seasons for fishing and a great way to spend time with the family, learn about nature, and explore lakes and other bodies of water.
