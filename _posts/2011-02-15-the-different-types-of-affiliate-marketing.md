You’ll want to start thinking about which road you would like to go down. You’ll need to be a serious candidate in e-trade in order to get the full benefits of affiliate marketing. 

Here are some of your options. First, you’ll want to consider using ppc or pay per click as part of your deal. This is a great way to pay someone and get paid. All you need to do is pay them for every click (it’s very little) and the advertiser will work hard in enticing others to click so that they can make more money. In the end you’ll be able to spread awareness easily. Second is blogs, but you‘ll want to keep it simple in marketing and promotions. You’ll find that this is a great form of education.
