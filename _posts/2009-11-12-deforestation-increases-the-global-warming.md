Deforestation is one of the facts of natural calamity due to increase the global warming. It got the most adverse impact on carbon emission according to the latest study at Australia. Thick forests serve as the sink to store he carbon and reduces the release into the atmosphere. It is observed that as much as 640 Tons of carbon is found in an area of an acre of thick forest.

If deforestation is done the carbon gets released into the atmosphere and pollutes the air. Hence, it is a must that we should preserve the forest. If we want to save our planet, we are planting plants in the waste lands that help to reduce the global warming.
