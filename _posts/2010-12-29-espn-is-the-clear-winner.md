Thanks for the article from Rubin Osborne

Many sports networks claim to have the best games available; however, when I turn on my [TVbyDirect](http://www.tvbydirect.com/directv-channels.html "Click here for TVbyDirect packages"), I only tune in to one network: ESPN. I mean, how could anyone believe CSS played the best sports? They limit their range to a few southern teams, and NBC only plays a few football and basketball games a year. CBS plays a little more sports, especially in the [football](http://www.barcelonafootballblog.com/ "Link to football site") and basketball genre. Since ABC is affiliated with ESPN, you know it will play some exciting games that you really want to see. That&#8217;s why I pick ESPN as my favorite sports network.

The shows on ESPN are plentiful; this includes shows on ESPN2. When one station is airing a game and you want to see the scoreboard, you can just switch to the other station. You have unlimited choices when you turn to ESPN, including shows like SportsCenter, Rome is Burning, NFL Live, Mike and Mike and more.

If you&#8217;re a fan of international sports like soccer, then you can catch those games on ESPN2. ESPN&#8217;s unbiased view of sports makes it the worldwide leader in my opinion. If it wasn&#8217;t so popular, then they wouldn&#8217;t have several sister stations such as ESPN3, ESPN Classics and ESPNU. They know people love sports, and they give them exactly what they want.
