Guest post written by my buddy Bernardo Graham

I am looking forward to watching [My Generation](http://mygeneration60s.blogspot.com/) on ABC. ABC is one of my favorite networks. I love Grey&#8217;s Anatomy and Rookie Blue, both of which are also broadcast on that network.

I am looking forward to My Generation because the show is about the lives of people who graduated high school in the year 2000. I am also a member of the class of 2000. I feel that I can relate to the characters because we are all the same age. It will be entertaining to watch people in their 20s struggle to get their careers started and raise a family. I am currently struggling with similar problems in my own life.

I watched the preview for My Generation on the ABC website. I don&#8217;t recognize any of the actors, except Daniella Alonso, whom I loved to watch when she was on Friday Night Lights and One Tree Hill. The show will premiere on September 23rd. I will watch the show via [satellite TV specials in Ohio](http://www.directstartv.com/localchannels/Ohio/ "satellite TV specials in Ohio"). If it&#8217;s any good, I&#8217;ll set my DVR to record it for the following week.
