For a long time I was dreaming about the trip to [Moscow](http://www.scrapsofmoscow.org/) and this year my dreams came true. I have the [cable tv offers around California](http://www.bestchoicetv.com/satellite-tv/ca/ "cable tv offers around California offers") at home with 4 programs in Russian and they are transferring them from Moscow through New York. Sometimes I get nostalgic viewing sites of Moscow because I had been living 6 years near it and had been visiting it every weekend.

I live in the USA for 2, 5 years as a permanent resident. But every year I visit my relatives who live in Russia and my friends who live in Ukraine. This spring I managed even to go to Moscow. I was dreaming about that visit for years. But I shall start from the beginning. I bought the tickets on line for the flight to Kiev first. Kiev is a very beautiful city, the capital of Ukraine. There is a lot interesting places to see in Kiev. When I was through with all businesses in Ukraine, I went on the train to the town in Russia where my relatives live. (By the way travelling by train is much cheaper than travelling by plane. So if you know Russian language well you can visit several cities in Ukraine and Russia using the train.) We went together with my daughter and granddaughter on the train to Moscow at night. We arrived at 6 o&#8217;clock in the morning in Moscow.

We took the metro to get to the Red Square. We visited Moscow before the Victory Day, on the eve of 65th anniversary of Victory in Great Patriotic War. So I took the pictures of Kremlin and St. Basil&#8217;s Cathedral. We bought the tickets to visit the territory of Kremlin. I was really very happy. My dreams came true.
