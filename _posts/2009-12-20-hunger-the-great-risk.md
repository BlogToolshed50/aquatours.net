It is a matter of deep concern to learn from the UN agency that one out of six people in the world are hungry without proper food. This level is found to historic high due to the global economic recession aggravated by high food prices. These hungry people receive less than 1800 calories per day that is the benchmark level fixed. The undernourished people worldwide live mostly in the developing countries.

According to the UN agency, this scenario is bound to pose greater risk to the society as a whole, leading to social unrest and lack of security. Despite the strong 2009 cereal production and mild retreat in the food prices when compared to the year 2008, it is estimated that there is an increase of 24% in the price of vital food items than 2006. The report given by UN agency indicates that the urban poor are going to be affected much due to this economic scenario.

Sub-Saharan Africa is having the highest hunger rate with 265 million undernourished people. As much as 1.05 billion people world over are said to be hungry that is 11% more than what we had last year. Unless the respective governments do not concentrate on agrarian reforms to feed these hungry lot, it is going to create greater security risk in the world.
