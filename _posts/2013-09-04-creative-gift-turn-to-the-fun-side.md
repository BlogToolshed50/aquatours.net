We all did scissor and paper craft projects when we were kids. That’s about all it takes, when it comes wrap time, the same tools and the same, “I want to have some fun” attitude to begin adding something special to your gift wrapping projects. Yes, that the biggest part: attitude. So if you’ve been using the store-bought look for wrapping, blow the dust off your childhood craft skills and start having a good time.

Doing something arty is using the fun part of your brain. That’s the right side, in case you are wondering. And we all have a right side, so what are you using it for? There are very few opportunities that are better than gift giving for sliding into the arts and craft mode. So if you don’t have the basic tools &#8211; scissors and tape &#8211; you should start making a list because you can be sure that a birthday or some other occasion is coming up.

Tip 1: One of the best tips I can give you for wrapping with style is to have everything at hand. You want it to look special but it doesn’t have to be a major project. The way to do that is to be able to reach for what you need. So have a place for tools, a box for ornaments and a few folders for color scraps and magazine clippings. All these will come in handy when it comes time to put your personal touch to decorating. It doesn’t take much room but the more you have the better your choices. So the next time your out shopping, stop by the party store or the dollar store for cute little items that will make fun adornments A trip to the craft store for a few items like rubber stamp of a birthday cake and an alphabet. Be sure to pick up a pack of colored paper and a pair of scissors that cut saw tooth edges.

Tip 2: Paper &#8211; There is an unlimited selection to choose from. If you are partial to a certain palette, say greens and blues, stock up when you see a bargain. Solid colors offer a lot of choices for embellishments and the use of contrasting ribbon. The plainer the paper the fancier the decorations. Try your hand at a corsage, putting together tissue paper flowers, construction paper leaves &#8211; score them with a wavy line and shape them. Then add lots of curly ribbon and long thread-like pieces of colored paper.

Tip 3: Experiment &#8211; before you wrap that gift, take a little time to explore any ideas that come to mind, or if you need a boost, thumb through your notebook of craft ideas. Here is a couple of thing you can try. Cut a simple shape like an open square or a hand from heavy paper to be used as a stencil. Then pounce, with brush or sponge, around the edges and remove. A spritz of spray paint will work also. Just add a wire handle to your stencil to keep your hands out of the way.

Like baking, snow men, hand decorated cupcakes and gift wrapping are a way to return to the playful side.
