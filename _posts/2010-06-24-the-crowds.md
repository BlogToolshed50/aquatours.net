Once again it&#8217;s time for the FIFA World Cup! The events in 2006 seem like yesterday and who doesn&#8217;t remember the triumph of Italy? This year the World Cup is historical, because it&#8217;s the first time ever it is being hosted on African soil surrounding the World Cup in a cheerful African atmosphere. I can&#8217;t wait to see how the African teams perform on home ground and of course watch the big teams in action once again, on my [satellite tv San Diego](http://www.bestchoicetv.com/satellite-tv/). Who&#8217;s going to be the winner this year? According to the bookmakers [Spain](http://www.soccer-fans-info.com/soccer-in-spain.html) are slightly favorites over Brazil, Argentina and England. I also believe we will find the winner among one of those teams unless some of the outsiders are able to come up with a surprise. As we all know anything can happen during the World Cup where the magical atmosphere is able to transform underdogs into heroes. Billions of viewers will be watching one of the biggest events on Earth all cheering for their beloved team to hold the golden trophy. During the opening stages we will find out who&#8217;s strong and who&#8217;s not able to cope with the pressure. The World Cup has kicked off once again and every football enthusiast on the planet will be watching in excitement!
