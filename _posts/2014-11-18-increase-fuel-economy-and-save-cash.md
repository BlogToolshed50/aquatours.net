So you want to save some green? All you have to do is drive smart to save green. It is not just about having an Eco friendly car. Common sense tells us that if more people took up the challenge our whole country &#8211; even the whole world &#8211; would benefit in a

1. It has to be said: the very best thing you can do to help the environment with your car is stop driving it! Well unless you are a college student, you may not have that option any longer. The best alternative then is just to drive slower instead. You see, most cars appear to save gas when driven at speeds of between 50 mph to 60 mph. So drive like Goldie Locks, not too slow and not too fast. This is how to drive smart, save green.

2. If you desire to make your car more fuel efficient you could conserve a staggering 20% of your car&#8217;s fuel consumption just by reducing tire roll resistance! If you are to drive smart and save green then you need to think about this. Simply spend a bit more and buy quality tires. Even though they might cost a little more they will perform better. It is important to note that under inflated tires cost you more in gas bills! So here is another simple way to increase fuel economy, imagine if everyone did it.

3. I&#8217;ll bet there are many items that you store in your car&#8217;s trunk that don&#8217;t need to be there. Lighten the load in your car. Each season go through each item you regularly carry. In spring get rid of your winter emergency gear. If you don&#8217;t really need it, well recycle it some how. This is the most cost effective wayto drive smart, save green &#8211; just drive with a lighter load. That will let your car be more fuel efficient.

4. If you are going to be sitting still for long, switch off your engine while you wait. Realistically, if you are likely to be waiting more than one minute than restarting your engine burns roughly about the same amount as one minute of idle time. So it is worth considering if you think you will be idling for more than a minute, cut the engine. You&#8217;ll save gas and money &#8211; drive smart, save green.

5. Drive in a more gradual and smooth manner. While really this one might be obvious on its face, it should be the unspoken rule of drive smart, drive green. Erratic driving full of sudden starts and hard braking uses up a lot of extra gas. Not to mention the extra wear and tear on your car, which means extra costs to you and the environment.

So as you can see, learning to drive smart, save green is basically just common sense. Some people really need their cars to get around. It that is you, then learn to drive it responsibly and sensibly. The best alternative is if you can walk easily to where you need to go, then just do it! Walk across the parking lot to the video rental store. So if you must drive than drive smart, save green when you can&#8217;t walk
