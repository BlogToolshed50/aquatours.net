It refers to the strategies aimed at improving the milk production. When the population started increasing astronomically the demand for the milk and milk products too increased in the world. The demand of supply mismatch has resulted to increase the cost of various milk products. With the existing cattle population it became very difficult to meet out the demand and many countries were depending upon the conventional cattle breeds.

Hence, the scientists in the world started this white revolution to introduce the crossbred cows and other milch animals to increase the productio9n. Such introduction of the high yielding cross breed milch animals added to the production improving the supply. Health aspect of human being is also taken care of the increased supplies of milk and milk products world over.
