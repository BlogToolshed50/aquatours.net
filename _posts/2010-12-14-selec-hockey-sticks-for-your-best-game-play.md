Hockey equipment is required for all players who step onto the ice but some differences exist regarding the hockey equipment utilized by different leagues. Playersâ€™ hockey equipment generally consists of skates, shin pads, gloves, hockey pants, sticks, and helmets. The hockey stick tends to be the most vital, apart from your body protection.

Choosing hockey sticks that suit you best is important. If you choose the wrong sticks you could end up playing badly or even doing yourself an injury. So how do you work out which hockey sticks are right for you? Here are some helpful tips.

Firstly, when standing in your skates, your stick should reach your chin. Some defence based players prefer a longer stick to give them more reach when they&#8217;re defending. If you can, buy your sticks a little long and have the shop cut them down. This is far better than having a stick that is too long or too short. Most people tend to find they have to have their stick customized to give them their optimum comfort.

You can work out what length you need by looking closely at the wear of the tape on the bottom of your stick. If the tape is worn down near the toe, then you should probably consider a longer stick. If the tape instead is worn near the heel, then you should probably consider a shorter stick. Ultimately you should try sticks at different lengths until you find one that&#8217;s got a comfortable weight and feel for you.

When choosing hockey sticks you should also consider weight and blade size. Most players recommend wrapping both the stick handle and the blade with a layer of tape. This is done to assure both a tighter grip on the handle and so that the puck does not slide off of the blade as easy as normal. If you are new to the game and have yet to tape your stick then we recommend that you do this early on. As outlined above, it will help you measure your game.

Different curves will affect the way you stick handle and shoot the puck too. Again, when you&#8217;re starting off and new to the game, it is a good idea to try different curves until you find one that feels comfortable. Like with all sports equipment, the best idea is try out a few different hockey sticks so that you find one that conforms to your style.
