Corruption has become rampant nowadays I all walks of life. Most of the Nations are fighting against such corruption through various legislation and rules to deter the people. Even amongst the well educated the evil of corruption has manifested to a great extent that they tend to justify such practices to amass wealth. In fact, it is shame for the part of the human kind that the countries are being ranked based on the degree of corruption prevailing in the respective countries. One should try to lead a life without corruption and set example to others to emulate.
