Carbon Credit is the latest means used in the field of arresting pollution. Nations which are contributing to the pollution level are deterred to pollute further by taxing them to spend on carbon credit. Under Kyota Protocal the Nation that is emitting more carbon into the atmosphere is to purchase carbon credit form such countries that are releasing less into the atmosphere. One ton of carbon that is released out is equivalent to one unit of carbon credit and it is priced.
