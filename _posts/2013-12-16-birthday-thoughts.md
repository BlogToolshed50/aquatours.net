Birthdays are generally associated with celebrations. Partying, receiving good wishes, gifts and holidaying without any care in the world. These are the main themes of everyone&#8217;s birthday. Here is a huge collection of great Birthday wishes e-cards. You can view them and chose the best to send across to friends and family. But what if I am asked to talk to God on my birthday? I will speak thus -

God, thank you very much for bringing me in this world. Without your wish I would not have been here. God, I also thank my parents for bringing me to this world with your blessings. I am especially obliged to my mother for taking my care when I was inside her body. God, I thank my father for showing me how to live in this world and being with me in my early days. God, today, I thank everyone who has played any role in helping me in my life till today. I also thank the earth, the sky, the nature and everything without which the life would be no where.

God, I also apologize to everyone today. I might have knowingly or unknowingly hurt many people in my life. I apologize to them. God, I might have done many wrong things in my life but I have also done few good things with your guidance. God, I am proud of my achievements and myself. I know that I may not get all that I want and may not reach all of my goals, but with your guidance I will try to achieve as many of them as possible. I want to contribute in a small way to make this world a better place. Please guide me about that. What should I do so that I get inner satisfaction of doing something for the society.
