With all the home energy saving tips and conservation ideas available today, some homeowners and renters alike may not know what area of their home to address first. Consider this, according to the U.S Department of Energy your home windows are single handily responsible for up to 25% of the total amount of wasted or lost energy.

Windows provide much visible and decorative appeal. However windows are heat loss and heat gains best friend. Just consider how much better insulated the interior of your home would be without any windows, just walls. No need to permanently seal your windows. After all windows provide many other needed things aside from just a view, like ventilation, natural lighting and even free solar heat during the winter months.

Fortunately there are several more sensible approaches to reducing heat gain and heat loss at the window. Here are 7 no cost and low cost home energy saving tips and conservation ideas that will significantly insulate your windows, reducing costly heat loss and heat gain.

7 Home Energy Saving Tips To Insulate Your Windows

Inspect the caulk around all of your windows. If you can identify cracks, even small cracks, then reapply caulk to seal them. Cracks are a clear indication of moisture build up and moisture build up indicates air leakage. This should be preformed at least twice a year.

Take a look at the weather stripping around your windows. While you&#8217;re at it check your front, back and patio doors too. This is often over looked; weather stripping should be reapplied at least every other year, especially on windows and doors that are in high traffic areas.

During the summer and spring months, consider making the habit of closing window coverings (curtains, drapes) on south and west facing windows during the peak sun light hours of the day. Your windows facing south and west are exposed to direct sunlight several hours longer than your windows facing north and east. This will reduce unwanted solar heat from penetrating your home and give your cooling system a break.

Consider decorating your windows with light colored curtains, shades and drapes during the summer and spring months. White and light shaded curtains naturally and effortlessly reflect unwanted heat away from the inside of a home.

During the winter and fall months, get into the habit of opening window coverings on south and west facing windows during the daytime, especially south facing windows. This will allow the suns natural heat to penetrate your home and give your heating system a much deserved break.

Always keep your window coverings closed at night during the winter and fall months. And if your decorative taste permits, use tight fitting window treatments on all windows during the heating season to enhance insulation.

Consider using an array of energy saving window treatments and coverings. There are several year round window coverings such as cellular shades and some exterior treatments that can reduce heat gain by as much as 86% and heat loss by as much as 80%.

Some of these energy saving tips and conservation ideas are completely cost free measures. Some of these tips call for relatively inexpensive up front costs. Feel free to adopt the measures you see fit for your home.
