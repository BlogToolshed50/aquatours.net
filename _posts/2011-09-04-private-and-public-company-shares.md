Shares are issued by the private and public limited companies to raise the capital to run the business. The shares are issued and subscribed by the promoters in certain cases. In majority of the companies the shares are offered to the public at a premium or &#8220;AT PAR&#8221; in order to have a broader ownership. The shareholder nominee is also there in the board of the company as a representative of the other shareholders to voice his concern in case something goes wrong in the company.
