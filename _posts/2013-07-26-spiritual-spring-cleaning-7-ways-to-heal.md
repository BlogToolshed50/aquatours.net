Spring: it&#8217;s a time of renewal for Mother Nature and also for us mere mortals. As the weather gets warmer we&#8217;re motivated to de-junk basements, scrub windows and dust door-sills.. But don&#8217;t stop with your physical world. Why not take the single-minded vigor with which you tackle your cluttered closets . . . and apply it to your soul? We all have issues that block the flow of spiritual energy and hinder our growth and happiness. Now is a good time of year to zero in on the spiritual bad habits you&#8217;re living with and work to replace them with healthy new ones. Here&#8217;s how to start:
  
• Identify Issues &#8212; Pinpoint your most distressing spiritual issues: Be honest with yourself. Do you live in a state of constant worry and anxiety? Do you obsessively re-live mistakes or traumas? Are you controlling and aggressive or, on the other end of the spectrum, passive and &#8220;victimized?&#8221; Be aware of nothing that makes you feel depressed or powerless or unbalanced—anything that blocks the free flow of Spirit.

• Ask for Help &#8212; Turn to a trusted friend to help you identify your &#8220;trouble spots&#8221;. Tell a trusted friend: &#8220;I am trying to become more self-aware so that I can work on my spiritual health. What issues do you notice that I exhibit?&#8221; What you hear might be the last thing you expect. &#8220;You have a lot of anger toward your husband&#8221; or &#8220;I think you drink too much&#8221; or &#8220;You&#8217;re a workaholic&#8221; or &#8220;Every other word out of your mouth is negative.&#8221; This is tough exercise but will help you take a look at &#8220;you&#8221; from a different perspective.

• Find a Mentor &#8212; Seek out a spiritual guide. Do you know someone whose spiritual health you admire? An individual who seems centered, balanced, happy, at peace? If so, make a conscious effort to spend time with this person. Notice how she weathers the storms of life. Imagine yourself in her shoes: how would you react if your mother died, if
  
you lost your job, if of your children was contemplating a change in gender. Ask her how she maintains her unruffled feathers. You&#8217;ll probably find that the healthiest people, spiritually speaking, have been through the fire and come out on the other side. They probably understand what you&#8217;re going through and will be happy to share their insights.

• Start a Journal. Set aside time every day to explore your issues on paper. A problem with jealousy? Write about it in your journal—how resentful you felt when your friend finally met her soul mate, or when your coworker got a promotion. Write for yourself, not an imaginary reader. Let the journal take you to where it wants you to go.

• Meditate – a minimum of 20 minutes of meditation daily will open your inner world.. Meditation is a wonderful tool which will enable you to connect with your spirit, refresh your soul to simply recharge your batteries. What&#8217;s more, it&#8217;s necessary for spiritual health. Silence, stillness and solitude are basic human needs and we don&#8217;t get them unless we make room for them. Carving out time to meditate—time free of human and electronic interruptions—is basic spiritual hygiene.

• Start setting boundaries. Speak your voice. Take back your power. Have you given your power away? Are you allowing some other person or entity—a parent, a spouse, a job, an addiction—to shape your life? Do you take on tasks you would prefer not to do, or regularly squelch your opinions to keep from offending others? Now is the time to start breaking these patterns.

• Take in Nature. As often as possible, immerse yourself in nature. Find time to connect with the earth and its healing rhythms. Get up early and sit on your front porch to soak up the sunrise. Hike or camp or walk on the beach. Plant and nurture a small garden, even if it&#8217;s a pot in a window. Getting in touch with nature helps you get in touch with the needs of your own soul. It reminds us that renewal and rebirth are not only possible, but natural. Effortless. And spring, with its buds and birdsong, is an inspiring time to start your soul work.
