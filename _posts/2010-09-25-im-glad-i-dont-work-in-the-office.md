When I watch &#8220;The Office&#8221; on the satellite TV I found at [www.direct.tv/direct-tv-packages.html](http://www.direct.tv/direct-tv-packages.html "www.direct.tv/direct-tv-packages.html offers"), I laugh and breathe a small sigh of relief. I don&#8217;t work in an office, and after seeing this show, I don&#8217;t want to. But boy, is it fun to look in on their shenanigans!

Steve Carell plays Michael Scott, who usually seems as though he ought to win an award for Most Incompetent Boss. Although he is well-intentioned, he has no sense of what constitutes appropriate office behavior, and his attempts at jokes often fall horribly flat.

His second-in-command is Dwight Schrute, played by Rainn Wilson. This eccentric salesman is also a beet farmer and a deputy, and he takes every chance he can get to undermine Jim Halpert, who is just about the only normal guy in the bunch.

Jim&#8217;s lengthy courtship of Pam, the receptionist, is one of the sweetest romantic arcs on television, though it&#8217;s often hampered by the absurd things that occur at the Scranton branch of Dunder Mifflin Paper Company, where they all work. Alcoholic Meredith, dopey Kevin, uptight Angela, exuberant Andy, loopy Creed and many other quirky characters make this a show in which you never know just what is going to happen.

Next year, Carell will leave &#8220;The Office,&#8221; and it&#8217;s hard to imagine who else can hold down the fort. I hope he leaves it in good hands.
