And therein lies the key to success at anything and everything: NEVER QUIT! As long as you never quit, you cannot fail!

Well, by now everyone has realized that the little lady in the story eventually realized all of her fondest dreams and wishes—not because she sat around idly daydreaming
and wishing, but because she activated her faith and put wings on her dreams.

She got READY to receive her blessings. She took AIM with precision by knowing exactly what she wanted. She FIRED her "magic bullet" rifle repeatedly until each dream 
materialized. It never occurred to her to stop firing—and when her rifle was emptied out, she just reloaded and continued to fire until things were just as she had pictured them.

Notice that at no time did she use a shotgun—her aim was highly targeted, and she kept her eyes on her goals at all times. In the face of any adversity, she put "blinders" on and plunged 
ahead with dogged determination.

Which brings us to another piece of the equation: persistence. Another way to describe persistence is not to take "no" for an answer. And there is only one thing that will allow you to 
conjure up persistence: burning desire. You must desire the object of your dreams with ALL YOUR HEART. The Lord said, "You will find me when you search for me with all your heart."

There is an old song called "You've Gotta Have Heart." That's what everything is all about, folks. A head with no heart is a dead head. 
There is another song called "Follow Your Heart." It's just another way of saying "following the leading of the Spirit." Go with your 
heart's desire.

If you're "all about business," do what your heart tells you, even if there appears to be little or no money in it at the beginning. If 
you do what you love, the money will come. And what good is all the money in the world anyway if you are miserable, because you
haven't found your niche?

On the other hand, I don't mean to imply that you should abandon good common sense and go off "half cocked." Listen to your heartFeature Articles, but do not neglect your responsibilities.

This is where sound judgment comes in. Faith is never logical. And the heart rarely is. Somewhere between illogical faith and love on one side of the scale and logical hope and aspirations 
on the other is that beautiful balance that will allow you to "have it all."
