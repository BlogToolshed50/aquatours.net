You must have enjoyed every vacation in your life and so you must know what it feels when you are in a vacation. You must think of the same fun and entertainment for your children to get and that too along with you.

You could also search for child friendly amenities having bathrooms with running water, nature centers, swimming pools or lakes and other things.

Before packing for the camping, you must prepare a checklist for the camping gears. Since you have your children you must take certain things which they need such as diapers, medicine, clothes and shoes. If your kids are old enough you may provide them a bag to pack their own. Ensure that their clothing is weather appropriate.
  
You also have to plan about your food for the camping duration. You have also take care that your kids like that food and will eat. You can prepare food there but apart from that you should have some snacks with you as kids might be hungry because of daily activities.
