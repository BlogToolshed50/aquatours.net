Whether we like it or not, spy technology is here to stay. Even if you arenâ€™t the type of person who wants or needs to use such technology in your every day life, you may find that you need to protect yourself from being spied upon. Just as there are various ways to listen, record or video tape someone secretly, there are numerous ways to detect those same devices. These bug detectors are capable of finding not only the various types of bugs, but they are also capable of finding them regardless of where they might be hidden.

Some bug detectors can sweep a room or person and tell you immediately if they are bugged, regardless if the device is hard wired, radiating or just sitting there not even turned on yet. These bug detectors range in size and are anywhere from the size of a suitcase, to a hand held portable, to as small as a ball point pen, which, with a push of a button can detect hidden cameras and even wire taps. Bug detectors also can be cleverly disguised to resemble something as ordinary as a smoke detector that alerts you to the presence of radio transmitters, regardless if they were secretly placed in your home or office or if they are carried onto your premises. 

Regardless of your needs, you can assure yourself and your customers of total and complete privacy when you when you use one of the many types available on the market today.
