Acupuncture is a type of treatment practiced worldwide though it is reported to have originated from China. Few argue that, the treatment addresses the symptoms only, but not the actual cause of the disease. The theory of energy is the fulcrum on which acupuncture works. When the energy blockage occurs, acupuncture needles help get the energy to flow freely bringing the needed respite from the pain as experienced in the case of back pain and other body related pains. Acupuncture is found to increase the level of natural pain killing chemicals in the brain which acts positively to reduce the pain.
