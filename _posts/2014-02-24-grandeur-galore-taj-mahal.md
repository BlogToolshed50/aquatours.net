A thing of beauty is a joy forever. Did Shah Jahan have this in mind when he constructed the Taj Mahal Card, the monument of love for his sweetheart Mumtaz Mahal? This is one question for which we will probably never find an answer to. However, when you see the Taj for the first time, you will know what it means when they say “Wonder of the World” Now once you stand in front of that grand monument in Agra; you will suddenly be stuck with the wonder, beauty, grandeur and majesty of the monument. My experience of seeing the Taj was a feeling which was completely out of this world. Here I was standing in front of monument that was built hundreds of years ago with the perfect architectural, design and work; and this was just an overwhelming feeling for me.

The Taj Mahal is one of the most popular tourist attractions in India and it is a must see destination for all tourist from India and out of India as well. The four minarets mutely stand as a testimony to all the events that have taken place in the Taj. Right from the time the monument was being constructed to the time when Shah Jahan, the Mughal Emperor of India, till the time when he spent some wonderful moments here with his second and most beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal. We will never come to know the joy, the pain, the heartbreak, the laughter, the innocence, the passion and the love that these four pillars have been witness to over time. If only those pillars could speak, we could have the story of a lifetime with us.

The best time to see the Taj is early in the morning at the time of sunrise, the view is simply breathtaking. This enduring monument of eternal love is built out of white marble. A huge white tomb flanked by the four minarets stand on a huge area of land. The monument is huge in size and once you go inside, you will realize how huge this is. If you are planning to visit the Taj sometime soon, make sure that you have plenty of time at hand. You will not do justice to this masterpiece if you do not explore its different aspects at leisure. The Taj has many mysteries waiting to be brought to light; you will need plenty of time to explore this magnificent monument of love.

People experience different feelings when they visit the Taj Mahal, but one thing is common among all of them. They just cannot help but marvel at the architectural wonder which was built so precisely and perfectly, that too at a time when none of the modern amenities and resources that we have today were available. In fact things were very hard those days and imagine someone actually made the effort to bring together so many workers and materials from all parts of the world just to pay tribute to the lady he was in love with. Can anything be better then this?
