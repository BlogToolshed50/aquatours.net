Healing modality is a message of empowerment. We are the creators of our own reality and have the ability to heal ourselves and to choose how we experience life.

Spiritual enlightenment is a buzz word in our society these days and it&#8217;s meaning sometimes gets lost. Buddhists have used this term for centuries but it has been only recently that we have adopted it to describe a process in our lives. But, what does it mean? To me, it can be simply stated. We see ourselves as human beings searching for a spiritual awakening when, in fact, we are spiritual beings trying to cope with a human awakening.

What causes us, as spiritual beings, to seek these human experiences in the first place? What sets certain patterns in our life into motion? Why do these patterns emerge in our own behaviors?

If you feel stuck;can&#8217;t find your passion;need confirmation of your path;are searching for the &#8220;why&#8221; of events in your life; this information may be helpful. It is like sitting on a fence, observing your situation from a distance void of judgment. Looking at it from &#8220;God&#8217;s perspective&#8221;. From a wider point of view knowing that there is no right or wrong, it just is. Identify your &#8220;primary life lesson&#8221; and how it fits into your life. Looking at these patterns from a higher perspective makes them easier to recognize and change. The intent is to help people move past guilt, look at themselves honestly without judgment and step into empowerment to create the life of their choosing.

Simply shines the light on those &#8220;dark areas&#8221;; those &#8220;don&#8217;t go there&#8221; subjects. Looking at your experiences from a spiritual or wider perspective, getting into the details of the events. From this perspective we will hopefully show you how the events fit into your life lesson and change what has always been a &#8220;negative&#8221; experience for you to a perspective of them being &#8220;positive&#8221; and necessary for you to &#8220;master&#8221; your lesson. This process is called mastery, which is the intent of the process to help people master their primary life lesson in this lifetime.

The results of mastery will ripple down through all parts of your being releasing blocks that may be showing up in your minds or bodies in the form of dis-ease. Really all we are there to do is to help you remember who you truly are, the creator of your own reality.

There are some basic assumptions that form an integral part of this process:

1. There is an assumed belief that we are simply energy which can never die but can only change forms or simply put re-incarnation.

2. There is an assumed belief that we are actually spiritual beings experiencing life in human form.

3. There is an intrinsic belief that we experience life within a field of polarity, therefore, we see us as separate from one another when, in reality, we are inseparable. Thus, the concepts of &#8220;good and bad&#8221; &#8220;right and wrong&#8221; &#8220;black and white&#8221; &#8220;love and fear&#8221; etc. are all illusions of polarity.

4. There is an understanding that humanity is undergoing a quantum leap in our evolution, causing us to seek higher truths to support our newly heightened state of awareness. (enlightenment).

5. There is an understanding that the human spirit is an incredibly powerful force of creation, and as such, life is simply a self fulfilling prophesy.

If we understand that we have the power to heal ourselves it is no longer appropriate for us to give our power away to anyone else, including healers and facilitators. This is a drastic change in the overall perception of healing. People go to the doctor expecting to be healed. Take no responsibility for your healing as that would be taking your power. There is no &#8220;shoulds&#8221; or shouldn&#8217;ts&#8221; given you. No regimen to follow. With the power to heal also comes personal responsibility for the healing.

The golden rule is as follows:

&#8221; Heal another and you may change their life&#8221;

&#8221; Help another to heal themselves and you will change the Universe&#8221;
