Greener light provision is the need of the hour in the world where, the carbon emission is exceeding the tolerable limit. In the day to day life, we are using various types of bulbs like, Compact fluorescent light (CFL) which is found to consume lots of energy to give the light and also emitting more carbon into the atmosphere. The recent invention of Light Emitting Diode (LED) is found to save as much as 50% of the energy consumed by the conventional CFL lights. It is quite happy with the result to note that LED bulbs have the longer life extending to an extent of 12 years working for even 60000 hours.

In fact, the initial cost of such LED bulbs may be on the higher side, but the same is vouched to be economical and eco-friendly. It is proven that a 20 &#8211; watt CFL bulb generates the same amount of light costing $3 and working for 6000 hours in a year. But the same amount of light can be obtained for 50000 hours through LED bulbs at a cost of $75. Though the cost is found to be prohibitive at this point of time still it is worth going for such type of LED lights as it saves lots of energy and reduces the carbon emission to enjoy the greener light.
