Research being carried out on foods and their nutrient content are showing something that should come as no surprise &#8211; that the foods that our grandmothers said were good for us, really are.

They can reduce risk of cancer or heart problems, lower cholesterol, improve bone strength and brain function, control diabetes, and fight disease. Without side effects.

They are so packed with vitamins and minerals and many other nutrients that come with astounding health benefits, that they are sometimes labeled super foods&#8217;.

There are many such super foods, but they have one thing in common: they are unprocessed, &#8216;real&#8217; food. Potato chips and burgers, no matter how fortified, don&#8217;t make the cut.

Super foods include oats, beans, nuts, carrots, broccoli, spinach, tomatoes, strawberries, mushrooms, salmon, soybeans, and yogurt, among many others. We discuss four of these super foods here.

Garlic

Garlic&#8217;s health and medicinal properties have been known for a very long time. It is used widely in alternative medicine. Studies show that it may be a natural antibiotic.

Garlic is rich in vitamin C, an important antioxidant. It is a good source of selenium, which helps prevent cancer and is also a potent antioxidant. It contains manganese which is needed for fertility, strong bones, healthy nerves, and brain function.

It is also a source of vitamin B6, which reduces the risk of heart disease and is used for production of red blood cells, and antibodies that help the immune system to fight off diseases. Vitamin C, manganese, and selenium are also good for lowering cholesterol levels.

In general, the stronger tasting a clove of garlic is, the higher the sulfur content and, it is believed, the higher the medicinal value. Organic garlic is said to have a higher sulfur content. People who want to avoid &#8216;garlic breath&#8217; might opt for garlic supplements instead.

Broccoli

Broccoli is considered by some people to be the ultimate super food. It is probably best known for its protection against cancer, especially cancers of the lung, breast, stomach, ovary, bladder, colon, and prostate.

Like the other cruciferous vegetables, broccoli contains certain phyto-nutrients that have significant anti-cancer properties. These have been shown not only to inhibit the growth of cancer cells, but also its spread to other parts of the body.

Broccoli contains cysteine which detoxifies chemicals and heavy metals from the body, helping to ease flu and cold symptoms. It is high in fiber, which prevents constipation. It provides zinc and selenium, trace minerals that are needed by the body&#8217;s immune system. Broccoli is one of the vegetables that help reduce the risk of heart disease.

It is rich in vitamin C, and in the powerful antioxidants lute-in and zeaxanthin belonging to the carotene family, that protect cells against free radicals. It has been found to lower the incidence of cataracts significantly.

Broccoli is not only rich in vitamin C (one cup of cooked broccoli contains the full RDA), but it is also high in beta-carotene, which boosts the immune system. It builds strong bones as the vitamin C improves absorption of the rich calcium content in broccoli.

Recent research shows that broccoli is especially good for the stomach. It contains a compound that is even better than antibiotics against the bacteria that causes stomach or peptic ulcers.

Green Tea

Tea in general contains naturally occurring compounds called catechins. Green tea is especially high in them. Catechins are flavonoids believed to be powerful antioxidants that neutralize free radicals in the body. Studies indicate that they can slow down the aging process.

People who drink 5 cups of green tea a day have been found to be 16% less prone to heart diseases. Green tea has been linked to cancer prevention as it inhibits the development of new blood vessels that spread the disease. It is also known to repair alcohol-abused livers, and protect against age-related diseases such as Parkinson&#8217;s and Alzheimer&#8217;s.

Caveat: Do not drink tea on an empty stomach, especially if you have gastric problems, as the acid in the tea can harm the stomach. Nor should you drink green tea or jasmine tea if you have a weak stomach or digestive system.

Fatty Fish

One of the most important foods we can add to our diet in our fight against disease is fish, or more specifically fish oil. Fatty fish such as herring, mackerel, salmon, sardines, and lake trout help protect against cardiovascular diseases, high blood pressure, and stomach ulcers.

They are high in two types of essential omega-3 fatty acids, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), that play a critical role in brain function and heart health. These fatty acids are found in high concentrations in the brain and are especially important for behavioral and cognitive (memory and reasoning) functions.

Some studies have been carried out on children with severe ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) who were given omega-3 fish oil supplements (in some cases together with omega-6 evening primrose oil) over periods ranging from 3 to 7 months. Many of these children showed marked improvement in ADHD symptoms, impulsivity and inattention.

DHA and EPA in fish or fish oil supplements help to lower triglyceride and blood pressure levels, and inhibit the buildup of atherosclerotic plaque that causes hardening of arteries, so helping to diminish the risk of strokes and heart attacks.

Extensive research also show that fish oils reduce inflammation, help prevent cancer, and slow down degenerative diseases such as arthritis and Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease.

The American Heart Association recommends eating fish, especially fatty fish, at least twice a week. However children, pregnant women, nursing mothers, and women who might become pregnant are advised to avoid types of fish that carry higher risk of environmental pollutants such as methyl-mercury. They can instead take a quality fish oil supplement that is certified mercury-free by a reputable independent laboratory.

Babies of mothers who are deficient in omega-3 fatty acids during pregnancy, appear to be at higher risk of vision and nerve problems. New research by the Harvard Medical School and National Eye Institute, reported in the journal Nature Medicine, indicates that fish oil supplements containing DHA and EPA may prevent eye disease, specifically retinopathy, that mainly affects diabetics and pre-term infants.
