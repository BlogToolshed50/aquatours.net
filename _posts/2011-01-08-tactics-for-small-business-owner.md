Up-selling is one of the most successful marketing trends today. Everywhere you go, someone is trying to get you to buy more. Its super-size options to clothing stores that try to sell you shoes to match your outfit, everyone&#8217;s jumping on the band wagon. Why? It works!

Your customers already know that you have great products and provide satisfactory service. They trust you to come through for them. Think about it&#8230; it&#8217;s much easier to make sales to someone you already have a relationship with.

Paint The Benefits Pretty
  
Customers buy because they want to enjoy the benefits of the purchase. A lady might buy a dress because she wants to feel sexy, or a man will buy a book because he finds pleasure in reading. Emotions are the key element that drives purchases.

Use word pictures to stir up the emotions that will instigate the sale. Let them &#8220;feel&#8221; the benefits, and they&#8217;ll be more apt to head for the cash register. Put them where you want them.

Create Attention Getting Headlines
  
Are you ready to capture your reader&#8217;s attention with great copy? The headline is the place to start. How often do you scan the newspaper&#8217;s headlines before you decide whether or not to read the article? Yeah, that&#8217;s where we lose or gain the reader&#8217;s interest, so it&#8217;s a pretty important part of the advertisement.

A good headline should telegraph its message in twelve words or less. Double check those headlines. Do they make a promise of a positive benefit, or ask a provocative question? Don&#8217;t settle for less than attention grabbing statements. 

Provide An Offer They Can&#8217;t Resist
  
Is your deal too good to pass up? If not, you need to improve it. Hey, I&#8217;m not talking about cutting prices even more&#8230;you&#8217;ve still got to make a profit. You can make the deal sweeter just by increasing the readers knowledge of the value of the product, or adding bonuses that are perceived as valuable, but cost you little. 

Motivate buyers with expiration. Yeah, an open ended offer encourages procrastination&#8230;which leads &#8230;yep, nowhere. When the customer knows he has until Saturday to purchase an item he&#8217;ll pay more for on Sunday, he&#8217;ll make it a priority to head for your shop.
