Making a trading plan is no joke. It takes a whole lot of effort and research to come up with a trading plan that is perfect for you. But the problem is, sometimes, when that ticker or number goes up and up or down and down, we aren&#8217;t control ourselves and jump the gun on selling whether for profit or loss.

The problem with that attitude is, once you break away from your trading plan, nothing can stop you from doing it again. Rationalizing your violation of the plan by any profit you&#8217;ve earned is just a step away for you. That&#8217;s pretty much where it begins and it&#8217;s all downhill from there. Pretty soon, you&#8217;ll be ignoreing that trading plan you made and just go with the flow of the market. Oh, yes, you&#8217;ll have a few successes and then you&#8217;ll be broke, having thrown away your money on sure things. 

What some traders don&#8217;t realize is that trading plans are more than just a few rules and guidelines for you to follow when you start trading. A good trading plan, and I mean a really good one, reflects your personality and should not be easy to break away from. When it is well-made, a trading plan takes into account your personal temperament and should be constructed in a way that all of its instructions are things that you will be comfortable with. This is why the first part of creating a trading plan is to always determine what are your mental limits are; both in terms of knowledge and in your personal character.
