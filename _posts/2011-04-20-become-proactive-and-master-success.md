We all want to succeed in life. We want to succeed in our personal relationships. We want to succeed in our professional lives. Yet despite this desire to succeed we so often do not find success. Just what is the secret to success in our personal and professional lives? Being proactive.

It is easy to place the blame for our failure to succeed on the many factors that influence our lives. Perhaps we were born with certain disadvantages or at least with no noticeable advantages. Perhaps our early years are at fault. Perhaps today it is our family, our employer, our community, or the current economic climate that is causing us to fail. While trying to displace the blame is certainly a very human reaction it is only a reaction. Assigning blame for our failures, even if we accept the blame for ourselves, will not do one thing to change our failure. However if we move past the blame game and start to think proactively &#8212; better yet become proactive &#8212; then we will be on the path to success.

The blame game is very limiting. Not only does it set you up to repeatedly fail, it does nothing to encourage growth. However once you move past blame and begin to think about what you can do and what you can change. Once you begin to take advantage of your inherently human abilities and strengths you are bound to find success. Human beings have imagination and independent will. This means we can analyze a problem, come up with a creative solution, and implement the plan. We have the power to change ourselves and our lives. This is the true path to success.

Many people are familiar with the term &#8212; proactive &#8212; however they simply believe it means to take action on our own initiative. While this is certainly a key component of the word. Becoming a proactive person is more than simply taking action. It goes deeper than that. Being proactive means that you not only take action but you also take responsibility for yourself. This means giving up the blame game for good.

In order to ensure your success you must accept your personal responsibility for your own failure and success. Do not blame others, conditions, or the past, but rather choose to respond to failure or success in a positive way.

Remember that failure does not have to be the end of the road but can rather be the beginning of a whole new path. If you can accept the blame for your mistakes and learn from them then take those lessons to forge a new plan of action then you are bound to find success.

You are a resourceful and imaginative person. These qualities are among your inheritance as a human being. If you use the qualities to take responsibility for your actions and generate new initiatives then you are bound to find more success in your personal and professional lives.
