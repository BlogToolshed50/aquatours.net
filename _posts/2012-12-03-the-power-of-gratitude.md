Financial wealth, close relationships and interior harmony are the major positive outcomes of one special force in this Universe, namely gratitude. Ever since we are really small children, our parents, grandparents, relatives constantly remind us to politely say Thank you for all good things that happen to us. While this is just the basis, there is nothing more legitimate than this sort of attitude. Of course, you have to genuinely feel grateful; otherwise, faked gratitude bears no positive outcomes.

It is all a matter of grateful, beneficial vibrations that are reflected into the Universe and that the Universe is reflecting back on you. The power of gratitude works in harmony with the Law of Attraction: when you are grateful, the Universe will give you reasons to be even more grateful for what it brings in your life. In order to maximize the advantageous effects, you need to take a few steps for deeply acknowledging the power of gratitude.

First of all, take a close look at the people and the events in your life that stand for the valuable and constructive aspects in your life. Think about their significance: it is impossible not to feel grateful for their presence and obvious beneficial influences upon your lifestyle.

Next consider those people and happenings which you really don’t pay too much attention to: they need to be acknowledged as well, so that you should be able to fully grasp all of the beneficial effects they have. These are people and events that you only meet occasionally, but that, nonetheless, affect your life in a positive manner. Now, when you think about them, you realize that you never really gave them a deep thought. But as you realize that, you also grow aware of the importance they have and you just cannot prevent a feeling of gratitude fulfilling you.

Also, take some time to contemplate what you want from your life and all of the difficult experiences you have been through. Truth be told, you need to be grateful for such less fortunate happenings as well. They are experiences that have taught you something, a valuable lesson of life you couldn’t have learnt otherwise. Yes, you have to feel grateful even in such cases. They have given you the measure of what you have done wrong and have helped you prevent similar potential unfortunate outcomes.

Finally, at this point, you can anticipate with hope and a positive thought what’s going to happen next: feel gratitude for the good things that are to come. When you feel gratitude for future beneficial expectations, you are in point of fact acknowledging the undeniable truth that such expectations are to be met for certain. Indeed, gratitude can actually work miracles: the Universe will not fail to reward you for your responsiveness to the benign gifts it bestows upon you.
