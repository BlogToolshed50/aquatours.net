Social unrest is being due to increase the unemployment rate. It is escalating in a faster pace in the world. Main reason for the same is un-employment that is prevalent. Employment generation in various countries is not in com-mensuration with the exploding population and that too with the increasing numbers of youths. Unlike in the past, the present day youngsters loath hard physical work.

In order to provide them white color jobs, it has become very difficult for any Nation. Though the level of un-employment varies between country to country, it is the maximum at African countries. In certain places the youths are provided with monthly doles to keep them fed until they get a job.
