Eating well and getting the vitamins and minerals we need over the course of our lives is important for overall good health. It may also help preserve memory and cognition in the golden years.

There is growing evidence to suggest that good nutrition plays a role in preventing or possibly reversing cognitive decline. One recent study found that healthy people in their late 60s were able to boost their mental capabilities by taking nutritional supplements.

Certain B vitamins, such as niacin, contribute to the formation of proteins that are needed for memory. As well, antioxidants like vitamins A, C, and E, and selenium may play a role in enhancing mental ability and protecting against dementia and diseases like Alzheimer&#8217;s. 

Because our understanding and means of dealing with cognitive decline is limited, prevention is key. Eating a well-balanced, low-fat diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables is important for good health and may slow brain aging. Seniors in particular are more susceptible to changes in their bodies that result in reductions in vitamin and mineral levels. Taking a well-balanced multivitamin supplement on a daily basis can provide good nutritional insurance.
