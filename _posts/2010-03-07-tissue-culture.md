Tissue culture is the revolution made in the field of Agriculture in the matter of propagation. Seed materials are normally taken from the plants in the form of suckers, grafts, etc.,. But the resulting plants grown out of the seeds taken were not uniform

in giving the yield. To ensure better yield and quality of the produce, the method of taking the tissue from the parts of a plant with desirable character and develop the seed material out of it to ensure uniformity was invented. Green-house atmosphere permits such tissue culture propagate materials.
