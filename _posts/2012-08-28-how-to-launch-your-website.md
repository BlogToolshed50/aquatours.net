With millions of websites popping up on the internet each and everyday, we all have pretty much come to the conclusion that it is nearly impossible to stand out. From music websites to blogs about celebrity gossip – everything has been replicated, distributed, and criticized. Amid these millions of similarities, it can be frustrating to gain any type of audience. Luckily, there are many ways to not only launch your website into internet stardom, but also find the niche that you have been desperate for.

Link Building

One of the most popular forms of getting your name out there is through link building. This generally means submitting your website address to a plethora of different search engines, directories, and websites. When your website address shows up on other web pages, it helps build your search engine ranks. Not sure where to turn first? Most people start off by submitting their websites to the search engine Gods such as Google, Yahoo, and MSN. Though rumors are circulating that MSN is going to be retiring from one of the top spots, it is still essential to get your website onto its engine. After all, MSN is one of the easiest to target. Additionally, webmasters like to connect with others. By searching for your website’s topic, you can easily find people who share common interests.

Reciprocal-Link Exchange

Once you have found a website that is similar to yours, it is imperative to try and build a relationship with them. Especially if you are a beginner, you absolutely need to acquire back links. This occurs when you display their website address on your own website, and they reciprocate by doing the same. As a result, you will not only have a higher search engine ranking, but you will be promoting yourself to other audiences at the same time. Want to know a secret? Some say that if you target a popular website that already has a steady ranking, you may be able to jump up to the first thousand results much more quickly.

Article Submissions

One trick that many newcomers don’t acknowledge is the idea of article submissions. Are you a writer who has always dreamt of being published on the internet? Many webmasters are now writing articles on their website’s topic and submitting it to DMOZ, and other article directory websites. In most cases, webmasters sneak in their own web address to promote their site and build a back link. Moreover, you can also write a press release announcing your website and what it has to offer. By doing this, fellow webmasters and potential visitors can be targeted.

Regardless of what your goal is, promoting your website can be amusing. All it takes is a creative mind, remembering that back links count miraculously, and that networking is essential. With those concepts intact, you can easily stand out among the crowd. The more creative individual paths you take, the more likely you are to have the #1 website on the web.
