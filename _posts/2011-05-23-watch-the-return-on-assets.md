In the fierce competitive atmosphere in all the business sectors, it is imperative that one should choose the right type of activity that demands less investment in the form of asset. It can ensure better return on the asset to maximize the benefit to the stake holders who had invested in the company in the form of shares, capital, etc., Lesser the asset requirement, the more will be the income.

In the capital intensive sectors like telecommunication, car manufacturers and much more, the return on the asset remains less when compared to the business like software companies. An investor needs to apply his mind to select the right type of company based on the requirement of the assets to get better return of his investment. The asset intensity in any business decides the return to the ultimate shareholders.
