Almost all of us own laptops these days. It has become an inherent part of our lifestyle. Since most laptops are running almost the entire day, the battery on them get exhausted pretty quickly due to extensive use. Buying [hp batteries](http://www.thesource.ca/estore/category.aspx?language=en-CA&catalog=Online&category=notebook_battery) are pretty simple on thesource.ca. They are listed in easily searchable, sortable format so that you can pick the one that best fits your laptop model. One thing that I always like to do is to buy batteries beforehand if I am already over two years of use on a laptop. If just keeps it handy for me to immediately replace new batteries when the old ones die out.
