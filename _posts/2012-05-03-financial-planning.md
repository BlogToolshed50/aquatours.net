Planning for your financial future and putting away money for a rainy day is more important now that it ever was. The term financial planning can be used to cover a variety of subjects, everything from retirement planning to buying a home to starting your own business. Whether you prefer to handle your financial planning on your own or engage the services of a financial planning professional, the most important part is making the decision to get a handle on your finances and take charge of your financial decisions.

Saving up money and building a good financial base can be very difficult. Most people are lucky to have anything left over at the end of the month after all the bills are paid. There is no doubt that putting away a couple of bucks every month will take some scrimping and determination on your part, but the power of time and compounding will help those couple of dollars a month grow into a substantial nest egg over time.

The most basic part of a good financial plan is creating, and sticking to, a realistic monthly budget. You would be surprised at the number of people who have never taken the time to create a simple budget. Without a budget, you may have no idea where your money is actually going, and consequently no idea how to save enough money to invest each month. Once you have created your budget, you may well be able to find ways to save at least enough money each month to invest in a good mutual fund. Many mutual funds will allow you to put in as little as $50 a month. That may not sound like much, but after 20 or 30 years of growth, those $50 monthly payments can grow to a sizable investment account.

Another good way to invest is to sock the money away before you even see it. This can make your financial planning easy and painless because the money just comes off the top of your paycheck each week. Many employers offer a 401(k) or 403(b) plan to their employees for retirement. These plans allow employees to have a specific percentage of their salary diverted to an investment account to save for retirement. The first great thing about these plans is that the money diverted is not taxed, thereby lowering your overall tax bill. The second great thing about these plans is that most employers match a percentage of the employee&#8217;s contribution. And the third great thing about these plans is the power of compounding over time. By just leaving that money alone and adding to it for 30 years, you will be surprised at how fast it grows into a substantial retirement asset. A good retirement program should be the cornerstone of your financial planning.
