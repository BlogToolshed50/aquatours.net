Most people find themselves dreaming about being rich but never actually doing anything about it. A combination of procrastination and &#8216;what if&#8217; syndrome can cripple your creative spirit and might mean your idea will never become a reality. 

Socrates said &#8220;Action equals knowledge&#8217;. He was one of the greatest philosophers of our time. What he meant was that it is through action that we achieve results. 

For example, you could think about learning Spanish for months, imagining the holidays you will take and the people you will communicate with. You can dream forever but accomplish nothing unless you actually make the effort to start taking lessons.
  
Much like the martial arts approach &#8211; the idea is to take action immediately and avoid over analyzing the situation. 

Do you want to start your own business but are afraid of what kinds of things can go wrong? What if your initial investment doesn&#8217;t pay off? There are millions of things that could go wrong but likewise there are many things that can go right! Fear can be paralyzing. When thinking about starting a business particularly if you keep waiting for the right time. There will never be a perfect time. It&#8217;s now or never when it comes to starting your own business. 

Overcoming your fear is a step by step process. 

- Do you have a clear idea of what kind of business you want to start? A clear plan will help keep your worries at bay.
  
- Do you have access to the resources you will need? This includes the necessary start up cash as well as anything else you will need.
  
- Do you have access to clients or do you know enough about marketing basics to ensure you will have enough interest in what you are offering? 

Just like anything &#8211; taking action is the most important part. Make an itemized list of what you feel needs to be done in order for you to start that business you always dreamed of. 

Prioritizing your list will help too. Don&#8217;t wait for all your ducks to be in a proverbial row before you begin but make sure you have all the basics covered. Don&#8217;t wait for that &#8216;perfect someday&#8217;. Make an imperfect start. 

Don&#8217;t over think everything. Sometimes the best approach is to just jump into the deep end.

Don&#8217;t wait to start discovering your own entrepreneurial spirit. Take action today!
