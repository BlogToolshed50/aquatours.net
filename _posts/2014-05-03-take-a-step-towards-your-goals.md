Not happy with your current state? Want more cheer, a better house, a stronger relationship, a job where you are respected and valued, or want to earn more, close more sales and buy that dream car?

Well, Quit dreaming. Just thinking about them and not taking any single step towards your dreams, your aspirations, and your desires is not going to bring them to you. That&#8217;s just wishful thinking.

The moment you decide that you want something, and surge ahead to take the next step in that direction, then providence moves too, in your direction. And the object of your desire comes a step closer to you.

Rather than just dreaming, when you focus on what you want, and take the time to write it down, it becomes permanently imprinted in your subconscious. Our brain has a problem solving mechanism. You give it a problem, and it starts to find a solution all the time, even when you don&#8217;t know about it. The power of the subconscious mind is limitless. The human mind has not been able to completely comprehend what our brain and our subconscious is fully capable of.

What is Goal Setting?
  
Goal Setting is a formal process of writing down what you wish for, what you desire, and what your truly want. Whether you want more money, or a better relationship, a new car or a better paying job, each of these is a goal. But just saying &#8220;I want more money&#8221; is not enough. The brain does not understand &#8220;more&#8221;. You must tell it how much more, by explicitly describing it.

Imagine if you were to asked to find a red house in the city. Without the suburb, the zip code, the address or location, you could roam endlessly till the evening, and not be any closer to your destination. But if you are given sufficient details about the location, suburb or address, sooner or later you will find it.

The better you define the object of your desires, the better it will be for your subconscious mind to be able to find it. So the first step in achieving your goals is to define them clearly. Write them down, break them down into smaller chunks, and divide them into categories.

For example you may have financial goals or career goals. That&#8217;s a category by itself. Similarly, you may want to organize your goals into these or similar categories.

* Financial / Career
  
* Social / Cultural
  
* Family / Friends
  
* Health / Physical
  
* Personal Development / Educational
  
* Spiritual

Once you have written down your goals in each category, group them into short term goals and long term goals. For example if you are earning $50,000 a year, and your goal might be to get to 500,000 a year later. Now I am not saying that it is impossible. Nothing is impossible! Unless you win the lottery, it will require a Herculean effort on your part to get to that figure in an year.

So chunking it down helps. Maybe, get to 80,000 in the next year,150,000 the year later, and get to 500,000 by the third, fourth or fifth year. Based on your goals, and how deeply and intensely you want those goals, work out your own blueprint to success.

Once you break it down to short term goals to attain in the next 6-12 months, you could lose 10 pounds, save $5,000 or plan for a vacation cross country. Take small steps, and get successful at doing the smalls steps. Nothing succeeds like success. As you attain small successes, you will get more confidence and more faith in your ability to attain your dream goals. Your motivation and inspiration will increase manifold, and you will be on a roll&#8230; going from peak to peak to reach your dreams.
