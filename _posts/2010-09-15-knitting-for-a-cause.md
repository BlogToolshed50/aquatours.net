I first started knitting as a way to wind down at the end of the day. I didn&#8217;t necessarily have any plans to sell the items that I had made and somehow most of my items just ended up in a basket in a guest bedroom. Once in a while I would give something to someone that stopped by, but for the most part, I was just knitting as a way to pass the time while watching tv or a movie. A friend stopped by one day and made the suggestion that I donate my items to a good cause. Of course I decided that was a great idea. I started looking into where I could donate these items and used my [directv internet bundle](http://www.cleartvbundle.com/internet_tv_bundle_deals.html "directv internet bundle offers") to get a good idea of what organizations could really benefit from scarves, [hats](http://www.leisurearts.com/Info/Knitting/knitting-patterns-hats.aspx) and blankets.

I settled on a local hospital that was collecting coats and scarves for underprivileged children. I called ahead and explained to the hospital that I wanted to donate these items, just to make sure they would take them. They were more than happy to take all of the items that I had. Since that first initial donation, I decided that I was going to try and do this every year. Not only does it go to a great cause, but it also motivates me to knit more throughout the year.
