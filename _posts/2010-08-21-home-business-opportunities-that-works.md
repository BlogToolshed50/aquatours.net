The traditional MLM involved holding house parties, selling products, and convincing other people to sign up for the home business opportunity. Many people have tried any number of these income opportunities and failed. Why? Because most people aren&#8217;t natural salespeople, and they have a limited number of contacts. They simply don&#8217;t have access to the numbers of people necessary to create the substantial downline that&#8217;s needed to generate residual income.

The new wave of MLMs, however, are Internet based and don&#8217;t require stocking inventory, holding house parties, or wearing out your welcome with family and friends in an attempt to convince them to buy products or hold parties. Instead, these new home business opportunities utilize the power of the Internet to draw prospective downline members to you. In other words, these are income opportunities that work for you, and that give you an advantage over traditional MLMs.
