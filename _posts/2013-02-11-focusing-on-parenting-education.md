Mainly highlights the complexity of our society and times by exploring the problems faced by diverse types of parents, children, and parenting situations. Moreover, the sensitive issues of parenting in unique populations are handled in a caring, straight-forward way with an emphasis on research-based parent education programs along with tips and strategies for everyday use.

The need to engage in cooperative planning, coordination of service delivery, and infrastructure development across programs, communities, and states is becoming acute. In some locales, voluntary networks of parent education and family support programs are developing, fostering linkages that promote coordination and access.

A stagnant economy routinely demands family employment in two or three jobs, leaving little time for effective parenting. Job insecurity often fuels family discontinuity and fragmentation. Unemployment, once the condition of the unskilled, has affected pink and white collar workers, causing more and more parents regularly to face complexities that make nurturing children difficult. Finally, the rise in the number of single parents, many of them teenage or never married, places heavy burdens on families and on society.

Changes in nomenclature represent one of several current issues in parent education. Terminology used – besides parent education – includes parent empowerment, family education, family life education, parent support, and family support. Some other issues include:

The equity issue: Parent education is alive and well in the marketplace, with affluent consumers exercising choice and purchasing information. Low-income parents have far more limited access to formal parenting programs and less discretionary income with which to purchase information. If parent education is left to market forces alone, the wealthy will become more information rich, while the poor will become comparatively and actually more information poor.

Parent education programs are growing in number and becoming increasingly diverse on virtually every dimension imaginable: sponsorship, funding mechanisms, audience, intensity, staffing patterns, and evaluation strategy. Contrary to the approach used in the days when parent education had a didactic, if not somewhat elitist, orientation, today&#8217;s approach is more universally adapted. While programs differ in how they carry out activities, they tend to embrace a common set of principles:

• focus on prevention and optimization rather than treatment
  
• recognition of the need to work with the entire family and community
  
• commitment to regarding the family as an active participant in the planning and execution of the program rather than as a &#8220;passive client&#8221; waiting to receive services
  
• commitment to nourishing cultural diversity
  
• focus on strength-based needs analyzes, programming, and evaluation
