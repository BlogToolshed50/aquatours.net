Did you have a theme this past year? Will you have one for next year? Themes can make your life fun and focused. Have you ever given a birthday party and asked people to bring gifts with a
"garden" or "fishing" theme? I know someone who asked people to bring something they made themselves! What wonderful ideas! To actually get what you want at your party!

A theme can help you get what you want out of life, too. Anyone who is evolving, can be helped considerably by having a terrific support network. Well, themes are part of a person's support
structure, the part that comes from the inside-out. When you have a theme for the year (or month, or quarter), you will be pushed forward towards your goals automatically. Why? Your theme
will help you keep focused by providing you with a starting point during your decision making process. Creating a theme is the first of 24 steps towards creating a strong
"Personal Foundation," a program that many coaches offer their clients.

A life theme can be a few words... or even one word to describe what you overall want to accomplish. What's important is that it inspires you. Some examples are...

Forgive.
I'm worth it!
Financial Freedom Here I Come!
Move'n on.
Have fun, fun, fun in all I do!
Put down roots.
Be present, present be.
Be a successful me.
With the holidays just around the cornerFeature Articles, now is a great time to create your theme for next year.
